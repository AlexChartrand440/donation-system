Flouss
======

**Flouss** is a simple paid content management system.

It uses *Stripe*, *Pusher* and *Amazon* APIs.
It's proudly powered by *NodeJS*, *AngularJS* and *MongoDB* (full stack JS).

This project is a simple demo. There are many security issues but it's not the goal of this project.
It's just shows how it's easy to make a little ecommerce website with all these technologies.
